Octo the octopus was an eight-legged creature. One day, he went to a carnival. At the carnival, he was free to go wherever he wanted. He made hundreds playing darts. He was very happy.

The octopus however, was secretly an alien. He landed on earth from an astroid. It was a mystery to humans what he would do next. They had no idea what he actually was.
